# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Latitude

The purpose of this project is to construct a Visualization Dashboard using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The visualizations are from a weather dataset and the website consists of:
  *  Landing page
  *  Visualization pages
  *  Comparisons page
  *  Data page
  
The website at the top of every page has a navigation menu that:
  *  Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  *  Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
  *  Provides two more links on the right "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
  *  Is responsive (using media queries). The nav has similar behavior as the "Navigation Menu"
